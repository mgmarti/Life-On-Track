## General info
We created Life On Track as an alternative to using multiple apps to tracking personal goals, habits, tasks and other daily aspects of your life. 

The idea came to us when we were discussing busy lifestyles. At first we wanted a someting to help us stay organized like a calendar or to-do list. Then as we discussed our idea more we also talked about setting goals and creating new routines to build new and break bad habits keepings us from reaching our goals. As we searched for an app to do this, we noticed we would have to download multiple apps instead of having everything in one app and this led to the start of Life On Track.
